//! Canonical process-spawning boundary for plow's analysis crates.
//!
//! plow's static analysis never executes code from the project under
//! analysis: it reads and parses source files, but it never runs an
//! `npm install` lifecycle script, a build step, or any other program the
//! analyzed repository could control. The single external program plow's
//! analysis path invokes is `git` (for `--changed-since` diffing, churn
//! history, and repository-state queries), always plow's own trusted `git`
//! on `PATH`, never a binary named by the analyzed project.
//!
//! This module is the ONLY sanctioned caller of [`std::process::Command::new`]
//! in `plow-core`, `plow-extract`, and `plow-graph`. Those crates pin
//! `#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::disallowed_methods))]` at their root and
//! `.clippy.toml` bans `std::process::Command::new`, so any new process spawn on
//! the analysis path fails the build and the author is pointed here. Routing
//! every `git` invocation through one wrapper keeps the "analysis spawns only
//! `git`" invariant machine-checkable rather than a prose promise in
//! `SECURITY.md`.
