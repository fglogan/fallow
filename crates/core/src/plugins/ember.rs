//! Ember.js / Glimmer / Embroider plugin.
//!
//! Activates on `ember-source`, `ember-cli`, `@embroider/core`,
//! `@embroider/compat`, or `@glimmer/component` dependencies. Tracks Ember's
//! build, test, and runtime tooling deps (so they are not flagged as unused),
//! whitelists the lifecycle and reflectively-invoked members on Ember's class
//! hierarchy, exposes Ember's filesystem-resolved conventions (the classic
//! `app/` and `tests/` layouts) as entry-point globs since those files are
//! loaded by the Ember resolver rather than by static `import`, and declares
//! Ember's `@ember/*` namespace as a virtual module prefix so
//! Embroider-rewritten specifiers like `@ember/object` and
//! `@ember/routing/router-service` don't surface as `unresolved-import`.
//!
//! Scoped to strict-mode Ember apps and v2 addons. Classic v1 addon layouts
//! (`addon/`, `addon-test-support/`) are intentionally out of scope:
//! they predate strict-mode `.gts` / `.gjs`, so the plugin's value-adds
//! (template scanner, virtual `@ember/*` prefixes, `.gts` parsing) don't
//! apply. v1-addon maintainers can list those paths via `entry` in their
//! plow config; v2 addons follow the standard `package.json#main` /
//! `exports` entry shape and don't need framework-specific globs.
//!
//! Template-block import tracking (`<template>...</template>`, `.gjs`/`.gts`
//! single-file components, and `.hbs` references) is handled separately by the
//! Glimmer-aware extractor in `crates/extract/src/glimmer.rs`. **Co-located
//! `.hbs` templates remain a known limitation** of that extractor: imports
//! consumed only by a sibling `.hbs` file still surface as `unused-import` on
//! the sibling `.js`/`.ts`; see the module-level note in
//! `crates/extract/src/sfc_template/glimmer.rs`. `ENTRY_PATTERNS` below
//! includes `*.hbs` paths so the templates themselves stay reachable as
//! files; binding-level usage tracking inside them is out of scope until the
//! scanner gains a Handlebars front-end. Migrating a component to `.gts`
//! removes the limitation entirely. Decorator-form
//! component, service, helper, and modifier registration (`@classic`,
//! `@service`, `@tracked`, `@action`) flows through the visitor and is not
//! re-implemented here. This plugin only handles the lifecycle and convention
//! members that the framework calls reflectively at runtime.
